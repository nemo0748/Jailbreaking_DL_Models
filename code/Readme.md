This folder holds the Jupyter notebook for the final. The code holds the tasks 1-5. At the end of the code,
there is a short reflection on the trends and lessons for this assignment. Each task has a large heading while many
small markups are in between the cells.

I also included a pdf to download and reflect on in the future.
