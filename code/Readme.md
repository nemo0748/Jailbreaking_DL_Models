This folder holds the Jupyter notebook for the final. The code holds the tasks from 1-5. At the end of the code,
there is a short reflection on the trends and lessons from this assignment. Each task has a big heading while many
small markups are in between the cells.

I also included a pdf to download and reflect on in the future.
